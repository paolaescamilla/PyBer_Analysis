# PyBer Analysis
## Ride-sharing data by city type
### Overview
The following analysis is done with the purpose of identifying the key differences or variations between city types and the rides of Pyber on each. 
Additionally, the intention is that this information can support deicision makers of PyBer to define future steps and activities in the company.

### Results
After running a cautious analysis of the dataset, the dataframe gave the following output:

The key differences in ride-sharing data can be seen in the following categories:
- Total rides per city type
- Total Drivers per city type
- Total Fares per city type

From the three beforementioned categories, the urban city type shows the greatest advantage in number compared to the suburban and rural city types. 
  - For total rides, the urban city type has an advantage of almost double when compared to the suburban city type and of almost 4 times more than the numbers showed by the rural city type.
  - For total drivers, the urban city type uses 10 times more the amount of drivers than the rural city type. 
  - For total fares, the urban city type holds the greatest numbers than the suburban and rural city types which is strongly related to the great amount of rides that are requested by consumers. The more the rides, the greater the accumulation of fares.

### Summary
With this analysis the following three recommendations are done to the decision makers of PyBer:
1. The Urban city type is the greatest consumer of rides from PyBer. However, the total number of driveres is almost double to the total rides which means that not all drivers are in constant use/rides. An additional analysis is requested to identify if the lack of activity by some drivers implies a threat or a disadvantage in productivity. 
2. The average fare per ride in the rural city type is significantly higher when compared to the one shown by urban city types. Perhaps the high prices in rural city types is the reason of the short use of PyBer. A market analysis is recommended to validate the appropriate average fare per ride is being used in rural city types.
3. Again for rural city types, there is a very small number of total drivers avaialble to cover the rides. An additional analysis is recommended to identify if this could be a potential reason of the low use rates in rural city types. Perhaps there is not enough availability of drivers to cover ride requests (which could also be linked to the high fares per ride - high demand and low supply).
